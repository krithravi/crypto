# crypto
Contains some crypto-related stuff I've written
* A Java program that encrypts a string using the ADVGVX cipher. It takes in the message, the passphrase used to generate the Polybius square, and keyword for the transposition part of the encryption. It prints the encrypted string.
* A C++ program that XORs 2 strings, without using the XOR operator
* A JAVA program that encrypts/decrypts a string with the Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, and if no key is provided, finds the most likely key and plaintext.
