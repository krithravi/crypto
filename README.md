# crypto
Contains some crypto-related stuff I've written
* A program that encrypts a string using the ADVGVX cipher. It takes in the message, the passphrase used to generate the Polybius square, and keyword for the transposition part of the encryption. It prints the encrypted string.
* A program that XORs 2 strings, without using the XOR operator
